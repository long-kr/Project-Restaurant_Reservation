- `Previous day` `Today` `Next day` buttons are used to move to the desired day.
- `Seat` button is used to assign table.
- `Cancel` will cancel the reservation and remove it from the dashboard.
- You can use the `finish` button to free a table.
- Creating new reservations will be restricted if past days, Tuesday, or post time.
- Reservation time must be between 10h30 a.m and 9h30 p.m.
- The number of guests must be smaller than the table capacity in order to set seats.
- I didn't add validation for the phone numbers since everyone can use it.
